Component, Router, and Injections

Inesita is a simple, light, Ruby front-end framework. Yes, Ruby, it's all about Ruby, and its ecosystem.
It consists of three main parts. Application is composed of components. Components describe the appearance and behaviour of the page.
Router routes given URLs to components. And finally store. Store stores data, this is just a simple wrapper.
You can implement your own store based for example on hash or whatever you like.
Components can be used alone and mount in any DOM element. You don't need to use entire stack.

How to start? It's simple.
